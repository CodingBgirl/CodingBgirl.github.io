I'm going to start by saying that I never, ever intended to do anything that had to do with computers or how they run. I was accidentally placed into and elective class that dealt with learning front-end coding. This is where my love for coding came to be. I decided to continue it for my whole high school career and knew I wanted to make it something that I want to do for the rest of my life professionally. When my senior year came up my guidance counselor to discuss what I should major in when I go to college and we narrowed it down to cybersecurity, web developer or software enginner. I went to college for a year and a half and didn't like that I wasn't doing anything that was pertaining to my major meaning coding or even programming unless I was doing it personally. When I noticed this I knew I had to change the plan and go a different route. To study to be a software enginner gives me happiness bigger than you can ever think of. One thing I love about programming and or coding is the trial and error part of it all. You create something and it has an issue where you and only have to fix it. It could take minutes, it can take hours but the best feeling in the world for me is when I've solved that issue. I think being a software enginner will be an amazing experience and career to have and possible share with the world.
